     <p><b>When the Land Gives Only Amnesia</b><i>(published May 21, 2020)</i><br>The wind and air here had cause to become<br>so hot that I'd forgot what moisture felt like<br>on my tongue. There was a faint echo of mist, wisps of clouds so faint, the blue sky would stretch hundreds of miles before the sun would fall asleep.<br>A distant mirage of emerald leaves on trees and jade<br>blades of grass would ask questions I no longer had answers to.<br>What happens when there/is no more anger left to burn?- When all that's left<br>is the dazed sorrow you carry in a small crevice between your breasts.- The unshed lakes of<br>tears you buried so far beneath the layers of skin and flesh that the progeny you harbor<br>has become so deformed they flinch at the sound of light. The sun<br>asked the moon to keep remembrance.- To hoard the progeny<br>left bare in the sun, when they tried to find that which I would not give.<br>It has been so long that I have not known<br>the meaning of mother. I know of only grief,<br> sorrowing, and lament. And just as I start to greet,<br>I break open<br>and laugh and laugh and laugh<br>lava, smoke, and ash, then wait<br>for the wind to carry it all away.

    <p>Find me on</p>
